            Our Story
            <br>
            Founded in 2023, LiveIn was born out of a desire to revolutionize the rental housing industry. Our founders, with years of experience in real estate and property management, recognized the need for well-maintained, modern, and well-equipped rental homes that offer more than just four walls. They envisioned spaces that inspire a sense of belonging, community, and pride.
